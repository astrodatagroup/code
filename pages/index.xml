This program aims to:
build a network of astronomers who participate in the open source community, through contributions including code, documentation, support, management, and many other aspects of this ecosystem, identify ways that we, as a community, can promote and support astronomical software development, and the people who do it, and discuss some high-level technical topics specific to scientific software development (e.</description></item><item><title>Logistics</title><link>https://code.astrodata.nyc/pages/logistics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 10:25:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://code.astrodata.nyc/pages/logistics/</guid><description>Logistics This workshop will be held in person at the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City, May 16â€“20, 2022.
