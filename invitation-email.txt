Dear colleagues,

We are planning a workshop focused on topics in open source software development practices for astronomy, held in person at the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City, May 16â€“20, 2022. The program and scope are still in development, but we expect it to be of interest to astronomers with a wide range of open source experience, and across all career stages. The schedule will include a large fraction of unstructured time for participant-driven discussion, collaboration, and co-working.

For more information about this workshop and to sign up to hear more details as they become available, please check out our website at https://code.astrodata.nyc

Please share this email with anyone else who you think might be interested in participating in this event.

Best,
Dan
(on behalf of the organizing committee)
