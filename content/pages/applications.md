# Applications are open

Please apply to this program using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTbvt6PDbA0Yl48tAhDdC-FuLOXxlI48H6hrQLZfCmc1IxIA/viewform?usp=sf_link) before **February 28, 2022**.
We aim to select a group of about 30 participants with a range of expertise and interests based on these applications and, since we expect this process to be oversubscribed, we plan on selecting participants using the "entrofy" method (see [dhuppenkothen/entrofy](https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy) and [arXiv:1905.03314](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03314) for more details).
The inputs for this process will be the responses to the multiple choice questions on the application form, and a set of target distributions for each category.
