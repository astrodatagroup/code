# Logistics

Our current plan is for this workshop to be primarily held in person at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics) in New York City, May 16–20, 2022. We will stream and record the plenary sessions to enable virtual or asynchronous participation in some aspects of the program, but we don’t plan to support fully virtual access to the afternoon sessions. In the case where this is not a feasible attendance option for you, please get in touch, and we will do our best to accommodate your needs.

Attendance at this workshop is limited to approximately 30 participants and, given the large number of people who signed up for this mailing list, we expect more applications than we can accommodate. In this case, we will select participants based on the application form, with the goal of selecting a diverse group of participants.

We anticipate having funding to support travel and/or accommodation costs for some participants, and you will have an opportunity to request this support after participant selection.

Please don't hesitate to contact [Dan Foreman-Mackey](mailto:dforeman-mackey@flatironinstitute.org), the chair of the organizing committee, with any comments, questions, or suggestions!
