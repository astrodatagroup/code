# Logistics

This will be a fully in-person meeting held at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics) in New York City, May 16â€“20, 2022.
Our plan is that this program will also produce useful educational materials that we will share broadly online.

We will share more details here and on [the mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ1GsC-WMeOA0wUxsnf5kxwiHBIc_zU3WgPOGAmYCP4H3ZJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) as the dates approach, so sign up and stay tuned!
Please don't hesitate to contact [Dan Foreman-Mackey](mailto:dforeman-mackey@flatironinstitute.org), the chair of the organizing committee, with any comments, questions, or suggestions!
