# About

**Astronomical Software Development** will be a week-long workshop/crash course/unconference/hackathon, where we will discuss and learn about the finer details of managing open source software projects in astronomy.
The target audience is primarily astronomers (at all career stages!) who are excited about taking their software development skills to the next level and to produce user-friendly, high-impact, and reusable libraries, but we expect that the discussions will be of interest to astronomers with a broad range of software development experience.
The specific schedule, format, and range of topics have not yet been decided, but some possible topics include:

- The realities of testing scientific software,
- Contributing to open-source projects of all scales by writing bug reports and submitting patches,
- Community development and project sustainability,
- Issues of academic credit for software development,
- And many more!

The program will include a large fraction of unstructured time for participant-driven discussion, collaboration, and co-working.
